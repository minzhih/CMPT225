### This repo contains the C++ coding of cmpt 225 assigment 3 (Sorting),4 (Heap), 5 (Red-Black Tree).

### My grade for CMPT 225 was not higher than my current overall GPA so I choose a passing grade for this course on my transcript, as it took me some time to refresh my skills in C++ after two years without using the language. 
### However, in the final few assessments, I achieved much better results. 
### Specifically, on Assignment 4 regarding Heaps, I scored 50/59 (85%), and Assignment 5 covered Red-Black Trees, and I achieved a 51/64 (80%). 
### On my final exam, I scored 51/85, against an average class grade of 47.09.
