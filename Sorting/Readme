This code (in .h file) implements four different sorting algorithms. 

Please use command g++ ./main.cpp in terminal for code running; ./a.out for the result show 

## 1. Insertion Sort
Function insertionsort sorts its array parameter using the insertion sort algorithm 
The function has two parameters, an array of any type (a template variable), and an integer that records the size of the array
The function returns an integer that equals the number of times its barometer operation is executed

## 2. Quicksort
Function quicksort sorts its array parameter using the quicksort algorithm
The function has two parameters, an array of any type (a template variable), and an integer that records the size of the array
The function returns an integer that equals the number of times its barometer operation is executed

## 3. Mergesort
Function mergesort sorts its array parameter using the mergesort algorithm
The function has two parameters, an array of any type (a template variable), and an integer that records the size of the array
The function returns an integer that equals the number of times its barometer operation is executed

## 4. Shell Sort
Function shellsort sorts its array parameter using the Shell sort algorithm
The function has two parameters, an array of any type (a template variable), and an integer that records the size of the array
The function returns an integer that equals the number of times its barometer operation is executed
