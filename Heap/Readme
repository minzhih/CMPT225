This code (in .h file) implements Max Heap implemented using an array which stores data of any (comparable) type and a template function called smallestm which returns a vector that contains the m smallest values in the function's vector parameter, in descending order

Please use command g++ ./Heap.cpp in terminal for code running; ./a.out for the result show 

The smallestm function should have two parameters: the first is a vector containing elementsof the template type, the second is an integer referred to as m
